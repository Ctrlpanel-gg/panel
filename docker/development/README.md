# üê≥ Docker Development Environment

This development environment utilizes standalone Docker with necessary tools pre-configured.

## Included Services
- Redis
- MySQL
- Tools like phpMyAdmin

## Not Included Services (for the moment)
- Pterodactyl
- Wings

Feel free to modify the Docker Compose file to remove any services you already have.

## Setting Up the Testing Environment

1. **Manual Setup:** As mentioned in the standalone Docker guide, you will need to manually set up some components.
2. **Custom Configuration:** Modify the CtrlPanel Docker Compose configuration to use your current project as a base. If you point it to an empty folder, it will clone the repository, and you won't see your changes immediately.

For detailed setup instructions, refer to the standalone Docker documentation.

‚ö† Caution: These instructions have not been finished. Therefore, there may be inaccuracies, instability, or non-functional aspects. Proceed with care.
