    <strong>Disclaimer</strong><br>
    Liability for Contents<br>
    The contents of our pages have been created with the utmost care. However, we cannot guarantee the contents'
    accuracy, completeness or topicality. According to statutory provisions, we are furthermore responsible for our own
    content on these web pages. In this matter, please note that we are not obliged to monitor the transmitted or saved
    information of third parties, or investigate circumstances pointing to illegal activity. Our obligations to remove
    or block the use of information under generally applicable laws remain unaffected by this as per §§ 8 to 10 of the

<p>
    Liability for Links<br>
    Our offer contains links to external third party websites. We have no influence on the contents of those websites,
    and therefore cannot assume any liability for these foreign contents. The respective provider or operator of the
    pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal
    violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not discernible at the time of linking. However, a
    permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of law. If
    we become aware of any infringements, we will remove such links immediately.
